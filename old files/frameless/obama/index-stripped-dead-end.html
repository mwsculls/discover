          <p>
          <p>"I've been a supporter of President Obama since 2008. I got chills watching his inauguration and I think he's done a fantastic job.</p>
          <p>"I'm a recent college graduate working in supply chain&mdash;I graduated in 2009 and I had a pretty bad first job, but the job market has really opened up for me since President Obama came into office. Things have been getting better every day.</p>
          <p>"We've had 29 straight months of job growth and I don't want to see Mitt Romney undo all of that good work. When President Obama's Recovery Act took place, that's when our economy started improving.</p>
          <p>"His work on the rescue of the auto industry helped a ton of my friends in Michigan. A lot of them have good jobs now as a result. I also really believe in Obamacare. Anytime you can get 30 million more people health insurance, that's great for this country. He's a strong leader who makes good decisions on foreign affairs. I support his stance on gay marriage. There are so many reasons why President Obama has my vote.</p>
          
          <!-X->
          
          <p>"Both of my parents are big supporters of the President as well. My mom is in the health care field, so it means a lot to me that President Obama stands up for women's rights, particularly when it comes to their health. My dad worked in a union as a construction worker, building roads and freeways. I know that President Obama believes in workers' rights, and that's important to me because of my dad's story.</p>
          <p>"I'll be giving more before the election starts and I would definitely encourage other people to donate as well. I had never donated to anything before, but I realized that I could pitch in here. When I believe in a cause and I support the guy working for that cause, I'll always have his back.</p>
          <p>"I've seen the benefits of Obama's policies. It's affected me greatly. My success is a direct result of President Obama's emphasis on the manufacturing industry. My sector has seen the benefits of his policies, and as a result, we're coming back. Made in America is coming back."</p>
          <p>—Ryan, <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/oh">Ohio</a></p>
          <p>Ryan is one of 2.7 million people who have already stepped up and donated to this campaign. Join them and <a href="https://my.barackobama.com/donate-20120822-HQB">give today</a>.</p>

          <p><img src="https://my.barackobama.com/page/-/FLOTUS%20Gainesville%20123.JPG" width="3888" height="2592" alt="" />
          
          <p>Yesterday, First Lady Michelle Obama spent the afternoon in the Sunshine State, making stops in Tallahassee and Gainesville to speak to grassroots supporters about the campaign. The crowds were huge, the First Lady was inspirational, and everybody was fired up. But before the First Lady took the stage, the audiences got to meet two young people and hear their incredible stories.</p>
          <p>In Tallahassee, the First Lady was introduced by Kevin Fahey, a graduate student at Florida State University who got his start on the President's 2008 campaign as a Neighborhood Team Leader in Ohio. Four years later, he's working hard to get the President re-elected in Florida by making sure that his community and his campus know about what's at stake in this election and what they can do to help out. He's taken the First Lady's "It Takes One" campaign to heart, because he knows even just one phone call or one neighbor you convince can make all the difference. In the end he told the crowd:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Throughout the fall, I'll be out on campus and out in our community, registering voters and knocking on doors, and right now I'm asking each and every one of you to join me…So come help out for just one phone bank, or come register voters for one afternoon, because as the First Lady says, it only takes one of us to make a difference here in Florida. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>A little bit earlier and a little further South, Alex Masi shared his story and why he's so passionate about moving this country forward with President Obama. Like the President, Alex was raised by a single mom who instilled in him the value of working hard and helping others. When Alex was a freshman, he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. He says, "I was scared and I didn't know what to expect, especially because I knew that insurance companies could call this a pre-existing condition and deny me coverage." But thanks to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act, Alex won't have to worry about whether or not he'll be able to get the healthcare he needs, and he'll even be able to stay on his mom's insurance until he's 26.</p>
          ,
          <p>Young people all across the country are doing their part to help get the President re-elected, because they know just what's at stake. A vote for Barack Obama is a vote for the tax credits that help families send their kids to college, and the healthcare that means young people like Alex won't have to worry about being discriminated against by insurance companies right when they need care the most.</p>
          <p>Kevin and Alex are doing their part to help move this country forward – what will you do to help out? Take the first step, and <a href="https://my.barackobama.com/20120920-gottaregister-ya">make sure you're registered to vote in November</a>.</p>

          <p><img src="https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/551356_10150655789121785_1543669010_n.jpg" height=225 width=225 align=right>
          
          <p>Matt started as an organizing fellow last fall in Dearborn, and became a field organizer this past March. When asked why he's organizing for the President, it's simple – the Affordable Care Act opened up new possibilities for his future—and saved his life.</p>
          <blockquote>"The Affordable Care Act is really personal for me because I have a spinal cord injury. I broke my neck 6 years ago and I'm paralyzed from my shoulders down. I want to go to law school, and without the Affordable Care Act getting health insurance with my pre-existing condition and without a consistent paying job would have been a nightmare. Now I can stay on my parents' health insurance until I'm 26."</blockquote>
          <p>Matt's favorite part of his job is meeting new people who, despite coming from different backgrounds, have all been touched by something that the President has done. Matt reaches out to the people he meets in order to get them involved with the campaign.</p>
          <blockquote>"By volunteering, people have a chance to really make an impact on the future of not only our country, but on people like me who have a lot at stake in the President being re-elected and having the ability to continue carrying out the policies that are best for this country and all of the people in it."</blockquote>

          <p>This week, as we start looking for organizing fellows to join the campaign this fall, we're introducing you to a few of the folks who spent their summer with us.</p>
          <p>Today we talked to Kelsey, who's been working out of our Exeter office. She told us that the reason she's passionate about making an impact comes from growing up in a military family:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"My father spent his career in the Army Reserve, so I know how it feels to have to say goodbye to someone you love. That's especially hard when they're heading to a place that you only hear terrible things about. My dad was deployed twice to Iraq. Saying goodbye to him once was tough, saying goodbye to him for a second time was absolutely the most difficult thing I've ever had to do.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Kelsey's experience of her father's deployment is what brings her to the Obama campaign in New Hampshire.</p>

          <p>
          <p><img class="picCenter" src="https://my.barackobama.com/page/-/dan.jpg" width="403" height="403" alt="" /></p>
          <p>Meet Dan Fournier, University of New Hampshire student and proud Granite Stater. He's also a member of New Hampshire's Obama Pride Steering Committee, and he shared a couple of reasons why he's supporting the President this year:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"I'm supporting the President this year because he holds the same values that I do&mdash;that every American, regardless of his or her background, has the ability to make it if they try. He's not just fighting for economic justice; he's fighting for social justice, too. The idea that everyone is equal before the law and should be treated with equal dignity and respect is codified in our Constitution, and that's something that I think President Obama embodies."
          </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>We asked if Dan thought the <a href="http://www.gobackteam.com">Romney-Ryan campaign</a> also shared those American values that the President embodies. Here's what Dan told us:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"The Romney-Ryan campaign is touting a Constitutional amendment to make same-sex marriage both illegal and unconstitutional across the country. That's a gross violation of human rights, and their desire to spend taxpayer dollars to promote and enforce discriminatory policy shows that their hearts are rooted way in the past. This is 2012. We don't move backwards on civil rights."
          </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>It's true that this President has fought for LGBT Americans in a way that no other President has in the history of this country.</p>
          <p>But if the President's record isn't enough for you enough for you, the extreme Romney-Ryan positions on LGBT issues (not to mention the values those positions reflect) are enough to give any moderate-minded American pause. Just how far backward do these guys want to take us?</p>
          <p>We can't afford to find out. If you agree with Dan and support the President on equal rights for the LGBT community, get involved by joining the <a href="https://my.barackobama.com/db-20120816-lgbt">LGBT for Obama group</a> on Dashboard, our online organizing office.</p>

          <p>
          <p>A voter must follow his or her heart on which issues move them to vote. </p>
          <p>A year ago, I would have told you that my brother Michael was one of the main reasons I wanted President Obama to stay in office. When he told my family he was gay, we told him we loved him and that we would support him—in this election that means supporting the candidate who shares our values on gay rights. President Obama's public announcement of support for marriage equality and the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" were joyful days for my family, and gave us hope for more progress toward equality under President Obama and Vice President Biden.</p>
          <p>Now, I find myself doing something I never thought I would have to do—in addition to fighting for LGBT rights, this year I must cast my vote to protect my own rights as a woman.</p>
          <p>How did we get here? When I look at the candidates' messages, I can't imagine a clearer choice. On one side, someone who doesn't support a person's right to marry whoever they love. Someone who doesn't understand why, as a woman, it is my inalienable right to make choices about my own body. And on the other, someone who gets it, and who knows that we can do better.</p>
          <p>Four years ago we dreamed of progress. We voted for a leader who stood up for what was right, a leader who would bring us to a place where all people had equal rights, and who would protect the ones we have already gained.</p>
          <p>I want to live in a country where everyone has the same opportunities to build a life, enjoy their liberty and pursue their happiness. This election, that vision only exists with Barack Obama and Joe Biden.</p>
          <p>Please be part of the movement that keeps America's progress in progress, and its values intact. </p>
          <p>Vote to keep our country moving forward. Vote for equality. Vote to re-elect President Barack Obama.</p>

          <p>On Tuesday, Mitt Romney vowed to let wind energy tax credits expire at the end of this year. These incentives are key to helping companies develop a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels. Wind energy not only cleans up the environment, but also creates jobs here at home. Mitt Romney's plan would harm both the environment and the economy.</p>
          <p>Unlike his opponent, President Obama has made strengthening the wind industry, and the clean energy sector as a whole, a priority. The President knows that "the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st century."</p>
          <p>President Obama understands the benefits of developing wind energy domestically. His plan to grow the wind industry is expected to create over 100,000 jobs by 2016 and 500,000 by 2030. However, Mitt Romney, on the other hand, would give big oil over $4 billion dollars in tax breaks while letting the wind energy tax credit, and the 37,000 jobs that it helps support, expire.</p>
