          <p>
          <p>"I've been a supporter of President Obama since 2008. I got chills watching his inauguration and I think he's done a fantastic job.</p>
          <p>"I'm a recent college graduate working in supply chain&mdash;I graduated in 2009 and I had a pretty bad first job, but the job market has really opened up for me since President Obama came into office. Things have been getting better every day.</p>
          <p>"We've had 29 straight months of job growth and I don't want to see Mitt Romney undo all of that good work. When President Obama's Recovery Act took place, that's when our economy started improving.</p>
          <p>"His work on the rescue of the auto industry helped a ton of my friends in Michigan. A lot of them have good jobs now as a result. I also really believe in Obamacare. Anytime you can get 30 million more people health insurance, that's great for this country. He's a strong leader who makes good decisions on foreign affairs. I support his stance on gay marriage. There are so many reasons why President Obama has my vote.</p>
          
          <!-X->
          
          <p>"Both of my parents are big supporters of the President as well. My mom is in the health care field, so it means a lot to me that President Obama stands up for women's rights, particularly when it comes to their health. My dad worked in a union as a construction worker, building roads and freeways. I know that President Obama believes in workers' rights, and that's important to me because of my dad's story.</p>
          <p>"I'll be giving more before the election starts and I would definitely encourage other people to donate as well. I had never donated to anything before, but I realized that I could pitch in here. When I believe in a cause and I support the guy working for that cause, I'll always have his back.</p>
          <p>"I've seen the benefits of Obama's policies. It's affected me greatly. My success is a direct result of President Obama's emphasis on the manufacturing industry. My sector has seen the benefits of his policies, and as a result, we're coming back. Made in America is coming back."</p>
          <p>—Ryan, <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/oh">Ohio</a></p>
          <p>Ryan is one of 2.7 million people who have already stepped up and donated to this campaign. Join them and <a href="https://my.barackobama.com/donate-20120822-HQB">give today</a>.</p>

          <p><img src="https://my.barackobama.com/page/-/FLOTUS%20Gainesville%20123.JPG" width="3888" height="2592" alt="" />
          
          <p>Yesterday, First Lady Michelle Obama spent the afternoon in the Sunshine State, making stops in Tallahassee and Gainesville to speak to grassroots supporters about the campaign. The crowds were huge, the First Lady was inspirational, and everybody was fired up. But before the First Lady took the stage, the audiences got to meet two young people and hear their incredible stories.</p>
          <p>In Tallahassee, the First Lady was introduced by Kevin Fahey, a graduate student at Florida State University who got his start on the President's 2008 campaign as a Neighborhood Team Leader in Ohio. Four years later, he's working hard to get the President re-elected in Florida by making sure that his community and his campus know about what's at stake in this election and what they can do to help out. He's taken the First Lady's "It Takes One" campaign to heart, because he knows even just one phone call or one neighbor you convince can make all the difference. In the end he told the crowd:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Throughout the fall, I'll be out on campus and out in our community, registering voters and knocking on doors, and right now I'm asking each and every one of you to join me…So come help out for just one phone bank, or come register voters for one afternoon, because as the First Lady says, it only takes one of us to make a difference here in Florida. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>A little bit earlier and a little further South, Alex Masi shared his story and why he's so passionate about moving this country forward with President Obama. Like the President, Alex was raised by a single mom who instilled in him the value of working hard and helping others. When Alex was a freshman, he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. He says, "I was scared and I didn't know what to expect, especially because I knew that insurance companies could call this a pre-existing condition and deny me coverage." But thanks to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act, Alex won't have to worry about whether or not he'll be able to get the healthcare he needs, and he'll even be able to stay on his mom's insurance until he's 26.</p>
          ,
          <p>Young people all across the country are doing their part to help get the President re-elected, because they know just what's at stake. A vote for Barack Obama is a vote for the tax credits that help families send their kids to college, and the healthcare that means young people like Alex won't have to worry about being discriminated against by insurance companies right when they need care the most.</p>
          <p>Kevin and Alex are doing their part to help move this country forward – what will you do to help out? Take the first step, and <a href="https://my.barackobama.com/20120920-gottaregister-ya">make sure you're registered to vote in November</a>.</p>

          <p>Matt started as an organizing fellow last fall in Dearborn, and became a field organizer this past March. When asked why he's organizing for the President, it's simple – the Affordable Care Act opened up new possibilities for his future—and saved his life.</p>
          <blockquote>"The Affordable Care Act is really personal for me because I have a spinal cord injury. I broke my neck 6 years ago and I'm paralyzed from my shoulders down. I want to go to law school, and without the Affordable Care Act getting health insurance with my pre-existing condition and without a consistent paying job would have been a nightmare. Now I can stay on my parents' health insurance until I'm 26."</blockquote>
          <p>Matt's favorite part of his job is meeting new people who, despite coming from different backgrounds, have all been touched by something that the President has done. Matt reaches out to the people he meets in order to get them involved with the campaign.</p>
          <blockquote>"By volunteering, people have a chance to really make an impact on the future of not only our country, but on people like me who have a lot at stake in the President being re-elected and having the ability to continue carrying out the policies that are best for this country and all of the people in it."</blockquote>
